## Introduction

> Halo Race Leaderboard is a fully public leaderboard that any Halo PC Server can opt-in to have track their times. This allows any server to get the lap times stored away from the server, and also collate all lap times together. Previously, lap times had to be logged in a text file, and mostly were only logged per server, and not inter-server.
